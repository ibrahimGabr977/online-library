# üìö Library Management System API

The **Library Management System API** is a Spring Boot application that provides a comprehensive backend solution for managing books, patrons, and borrowing records in a library. This project demonstrates a range of capabilities, including RESTful API development, data persistence, and optional features like security and caching.

## üåü Features

- **Manage Books**: 
  - Retrieve all books or specific books by ID.
  - Add new books, update existing ones, or remove them from the catalog.
- **Manage Patrons**: 
  - View all library patrons or specific patrons by ID.
  - Add new patrons, update their details, or remove them from the system.
- **Borrowing Records**: 
  - Track which books have been borrowed by which patrons.
  - Record the borrowing and returning of books.

### Enhancements
- **Security**: API endpoints protected with basic authentication.
- **Logging**: Monitor key actions and performance with Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP).
- **Caching**: Improved performance by caching frequently accessed data.
- **Transaction Management**: Ensuring data integrity during critical operations.
